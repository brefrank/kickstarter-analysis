# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Using data from our Kickstarter Challenge spreadsheet, a visualization of theater campaign outcomes based on launch dates and play funding goals has been created.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To gather an understanding of how launch dates affected theater campaign outcomes, a pivot table and line chart was created from data within the 'Kickstarter' tab of our 'Kickstarter Challenge' spreadsheet. To start, the pivot table was filtered to show only theater data and sorted into three groups by month. Data on each campaign had been documented over an 8 year spread, 2009-2017. Using this information, these three groups of successful, failed, and cancelled, provided summarized data on which months would be best to start a campaign. 

As you can see from the chart below, May had the highest campaign success and would be a good time to launch. More details on individual quantities can be found on the third tab, 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date'.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next, a table was created to calculate percentages of success, failure, and canceled campaigns relative to the monetary goals set for individual plays within the theater umbrella. To gather this information, COUNTIFS formulas were used. For each outcome,

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
